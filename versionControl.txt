(A) It easily lets you revert any counterproductive changes, preventing you from having to go back and manually revert large amounts of code. It is a very efficient storage catalogue for letting you revisit any innovative ideas for tackling specific problems that you might have scrapped.
(b) I would prefer for it to save a version when I choose it to save, because a version is supposed to be a monumental change of some kind. An automatic process is incapable, without the assitance of machine learning or advanced ai, of determining a monumental change. Any of the automatic processes described in the question would often result in saved versions that are incomplete and infunctional. A version should be include a new feature or function.
(C) it gives a brief explanation of whatever in the hell is happening with the newest change. It lets you quickly understand what changed happened where in the version history.
